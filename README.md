### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at St. Lawrence University majoring in Statistics. My most recent project is an 8-week long fellowship creating a Shiny App for visualizing student course evaluation data. Repositories from classes I have taken include CS-219 (Techniques of Computer Science) and STAT-4005 (Data Visualization). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for STAT-313 (Advanced Linear Models) in RStudio. I am creating a shiny app for exploratory analysis and developing multi-level models to predict Wilks scores using a Powerlifting data set.
